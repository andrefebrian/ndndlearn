##### Introduction.

ndnSIM is implemented as a new network-layer protocol model and can run on top of any available link-layer protocol model (point-to-point, CSMA, wireless, etc.). In addition, the simulator provides an extensive collection of interfaces and helpers to perform detailed tracing behavior of every component, as well as NDN traffic flow.
